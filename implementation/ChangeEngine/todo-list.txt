1. It would be nice if each instance of GameObject and GameLevel were aware of their own string names.
2. Create more debug modes to alter output based on level desired.
3. More specific error states.
4. Ways to get error codes from outside engine.
5. Needs a concept of "current level" to clean up code and prevent possibility of drawing items of non-current level.
